# js-templates README

JS Templates is an lightweight and easy-to-use extension for Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Create your own templates for files using only JavaScript and a little bit of JSON

Each template can take in any number of string or enum parameters that help you to create a powerful template

Apply templates to create files by simply right clicking on a folder in your project and selecting "Create From Template"

## Installation

Clone this repository into your C:\Users\[you]\.vscode\extensions folder. The next time you open VS Code, JS Templates will install automatically.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `js-templates.templateFilePaths`: array of locations JS Templates looks for file paths. By default, this is `js-templates/__templates__` and `[your project]/src/__templates__`

## Known Issues

This extension will not check if files already exist before creating from the template. This can result in lost data.

**Enjoy!**
